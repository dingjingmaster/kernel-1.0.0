## linux kernel 1.0.0

dowload url:[https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v1.0/linux-1.0.tar.bz2](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v1.0/linux-1.0.tar.bz2)

### If you install the full sources, do a

		cd /usr/src
		tar xvf linux-1.0.tar

   to get it all put in place.

### if you install by patching, you need a *clean* 0.99.15 source tree, which presumably exists in /usr/src/linux.  If so, to get the kernel patched, just do a

		cd /usr/src
		patch -p0 < linux-1.0.patch

   and you should be ok.  You may want to remove the backup files (xxx~
   or xxx.orig), and make sure that there are no failed patches (xxx# or
   xxx.rej).

### make sure your /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm directories are just symlinks to the kernel sources:

```
cd /usr/include
rm -rf linux
rm -rf asm
ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/linux .
ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm .
```
### make sure you have no stale .o files and dependencies lying around:

```
cd /usr/src/linux
make mrproper
```
